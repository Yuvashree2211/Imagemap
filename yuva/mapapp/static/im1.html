        <h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
        <P style="padding-left: 40px;">‚≠êLibraries can vary widely in size and may be organised and maintained by a public body such as a government, an institution , a corporation, or a private individual.<br>‚≠êIn addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained experts in finding, selecting, circulating and organising information while interpreting information needs and navigating and analysing large amounts of information with a variety of resources. <br>‚≠êThe area of study is known as library and information science<br>

            ‚≠êThe library's clientele and general services offered vary depending on its type: users of a public library have different needs from those of a special library or academic library.<br>
            ‚≠ê Libraries may also be community hubs, where programmes are made available and people engage in lifelong learning. <br>
            ‚≠ê Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of the building by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet.
