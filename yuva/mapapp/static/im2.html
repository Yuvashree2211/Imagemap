    <h3>DESCRIPTION:</h3>
    <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
        ❤️Gardening is the process of growing plants for their vegetables, fruits, flowers, herbs, and appearances within a designated space.<br>❤️Gardens fulfill a wide assortment of purposes, notably the production of aesthetically pleasing areas, medicines, cosmetics, dyes, foods, poisons, wildlife habitats, and saleable goods. <br>❤️People often partake in gardening for its therapeutic, health, educational, cultural, philosophical, environmental, and religious benefits.<br>
        ❤️Gardening can be difficult to differentiate from farming.<br> ❤️They are most easily differentiated based on their primary objectives. <br>❤️Farming prioritizes saleable goods and may include livestock production whereas gardening often prioritizes aesthetics and leisure.<br> ❤️As it pertains to food production, gardening generally happens on a much smaller scale with the intent of personal or community consumption.<br> ❤️It is important to note that there are cultures which do not differentiate between farming and gardening.<br> ❤️This is primarily because subsistence agriculture has been the main method of farming throughout its 12,000 year history and is virtually indistinguishable from gardening.
