            <H1>Advantages of Laptop:</H1></center>
           
<h3>
Mobility:
</h3>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
    ‚≠êThe main advantage of a laptop, as compared with a stationary computer, is its mobility. <br>‚≠êThe lightweight, compact size, the built-in battery within the laptop allowing it to simply move from one place to a different one. 
        </p>
        <h3>Finished product:</h3>
            <p style="padding-left: 40px;"> ‚≠êThe laptop is straightforward to use without any additional devices. <br>‚≠êIt‚Äôs everything like its own keyboard, built-in mouse (touchpad), built-in speakers, built-in microphone, many laptops have a built-in camera.</p>
            <h3>Internet access: </h3>
            <p style="padding-left: 40px;">‚≠êInternet access is the second advantage for the increase in demand for the laptop because it provides the power to access the web through wireless technology.</p>
            <center>
            <h1 style="font-family: 'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">Disadvantages of Laptops:</h1>
        </center>
        <h3>Frequent Upgrades:</h3>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;">‚≠êThe laptops are difficult to upgrade thanks to their integrated design. <br>‚≠êThe sole parts which will be upgraded are hard disc and memory as these are the sole parts that are accessible to the user.<br> ‚≠êIt‚Äôs very difficult to repair it. </p>
        <h3>Higher price :</h3>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;"> ‚≠êThe laptops are costly as compared to PC, because the smaller components required by the laptop come costly.</p>
        <h3>Difficulty in customization:</h3>
        <p style="padding-left: 40px;"> ‚≠êThe laptop doesn‚Äôt offer an option for personalization consistent with one‚Äôs requirements.<br> ‚≠êThe laptop only gives access to the computer‚Äôs memory and disk drive.<br> ‚≠êThe opposite components like processors, graphics cards, and cooling systems aren‚Äôt easy to access and replace.</p>

        <h2>DESCRIPTION:</h2>
        <P style="padding-left: 40px;">‚≠êLibraries can vary widely in size and may be organised and maintained by a public body such as a government, an institution , a corporation, or a private individual.<br>‚≠êIn addition to providing materials, libraries also provide the services of librarians who are trained experts in finding, selecting, circulating and organising information while interpreting information needs and navigating and analysing large amounts of information with a variety of resources. <br>‚≠êThe area of study is known as library and information science<br>

            ‚≠êThe library's clientele and general services offered vary depending on its type: users of a public library have different needs from those of a special library or academic library.<br>
            ‚≠ê Libraries may also be community hubs, where programmes are made available and people engage in lifelong learning. <br>
            ‚≠ê Modern libraries extend their services beyond the physical walls of the building by providing material accessible by electronic means, including from home via the Internet.

    <p style="padding-left: 40px;">
        ‚ù§Ô∏èGardening is the process of growing plants for their vegetables, fruits, flowers, herbs, and appearances within a designated space.<br>‚ù§Ô∏èGardens fulfill a wide assortment of purposes, notably the production of aesthetically pleasing areas, medicines, cosmetics, dyes, foods, poisons, wildlife habitats, and saleable goods. <br>‚ù§Ô∏èPeople often partake in gardening for its therapeutic, health, educational, cultural, philosophical, environmental, and religious benefits.<br>
        ‚ù§Ô∏èGardening can be difficult to differentiate from farming.<br> ‚ù§Ô∏èThey are most easily differentiated based on their primary objectives. <br>‚ù§Ô∏èFarming prioritizes saleable goods and may include livestock production whereas gardening often prioritizes aesthetics and leisure.<br> ‚ù§Ô∏èAs it pertains to food production, gardening generally happens on a much smaller scale with the intent of personal or community consumption.<br> ‚ù§Ô∏èIt is important to note that there are cultures which do not differentiate between farming and gardening.<br> ‚ù§Ô∏èThis is primarily because subsistence agriculture has been the main method of farming throughout its 12,000 year history and is virtually indistinguishable from gardening.
